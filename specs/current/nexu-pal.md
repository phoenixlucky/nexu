# nexu-pal

GitHub issue/discussion automation around **nexu-pal** issue processing and Feishu notifications.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Script |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `nexu-pal: issue opened` | `issues: [opened]` | `scripts/nexu-pal/process-issue-opened.mjs` |
| `nexu-pal: issue assigned` | `issues: [assigned]` | `scripts/nexu-pal/process-issue-assignment.mjs` |
| `Feishu Issue Notification` | `issues: [opened]` | `scripts/notify/feishu-notify.mjs` |
| `nexu-pal: needs-triage notify` | `issues: [labeled]` (when label is `needs-triage`) | `scripts/notify/feishu-triage-notify.mjs` |
| `Feishu Discussion Notification` | `discussion: [created]` | `scripts/notify/feishu-notify.mjs` |

## On issue opened

Runs in order:

1. **First-time contributor welcome** — Uses `actions/first-interaction@v3`. If the author has never opened an issue in this repo before, posts a welcome comment.

2. **Language detection & translation** — Sends the issue title and body to an LLM (`google/gemini-2.5-flash` via OpenRouter). If the content is primarily non-English, uses the English translation internally for downstream classification.

3. **Intent classification** — Sends the normalized English title and body to the LLM and assigns only the `bug` label when the issue clearly describes broken behavior.

4. **Triage label** — If the issue has no assignee, adds the `needs-triage` label.

## On issue assigned

Removes the `needs-triage` label (no-op if the label is already absent).

## Feishu notifications

Three GitHub Actions send Feishu webhook notifications for GitHub content:

1. **Issue notification** — On `issues: [opened]`, sends the existing issue card to the legacy webhook without changing the current chain.
2. **Needs-triage issue notification** — On `issues: [labeled]`, when the added label is `needs-triage`, sends a triage card to either the bug or non-bug webhook based on the issue's current labels. The workflow maps GitHub secrets to internal env vars `BUG_WEBHOOK` and `REQ_WEBHOOK`.
3. **Discussion notification** — On `discussion: [created]`, sends the existing discussion card format using the discussion category in place of labels.

The legacy issue/discussion workflows continue to run `node scripts/notify/feishu-notify.mjs`. The new triage workflow runs `node scripts/notify/feishu-triage-notify.mjs`.

## Labels managed

| Label | Added when | Removed when |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| `bug` | LLM classifies as bug | — |
| `needs-triage` | Issue opened with no assignee | Issue is assigned |

## Authentication

The two **nexu-pal** workflows create a short-lived token via `actions/create-github-app-token@v1` using secrets `NEXU_PAL_APP_ID` and `NEXU_PAL_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`. All GitHub API calls and the first-interaction action use this App token.

The Feishu notification workflows do not use the GitHub App. They use the default GitHub Actions context plus Feishu incoming-webhook secrets.

## Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `NEXU_PAL_APP_ID` | GitHub App ID |
| `NEXU_PAL_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM` | GitHub App private key |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | OpenRouter base URL |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenRouter API key |
| `ISSUE_SYNC_FEISHU_BOT_WEBHOOK` | Feishu incoming webhook URL for the existing issue-opened and discussion notifications |
| `ISSUE_TRIAGE_BUG_FEISHU_WEBHOOK` | Feishu incoming webhook URL for bug triage notifications |
| `ISSUE_TRIAGE_REQ_FEISHU_WEBHOOK` | Feishu incoming webhook URL for non-bug triage notifications |
