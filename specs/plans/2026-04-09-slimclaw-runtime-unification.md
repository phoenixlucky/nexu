# Slimclaw Runtime Unification Plan

Date: 2026-04-09

## Context

Nexu's OpenClaw runtime pipeline is currently split across multiple producers:

- `openclaw-runtime/` owns install, cache, and pruning
- `openclaw-runtime-patches/` owns part of the patch set
- `packages/dev-utils/src/openclaw-runtime-stage.ts` patches/stages runtime for dev
- `apps/desktop/scripts/prepare-openclaw-sidecar.mjs` patches/stages runtime for desktop packaging
- `scripts/dev/*`, `apps/controller/*`, `apps/desktop/*`, and tests directly reference legacy runtime paths and layouts

This means the repo does not have a single owner for:

- the runtime build entry
- the patch source of truth
- the final artifact contract

More importantly, this fragmented shape makes large runtime optimizations hard to execute as a closed loop. Any serious runtime change currently spills across legacy runtime packaging, dev staging, desktop sidecar prep, and test contracts.

## Problem Statement

The current problem is not naming. It is that the runtime artifact pipeline is fragmented.

Today:

- runtime producers are duplicated
- patch mechanisms are duplicated
- consumers depend on internal legacy paths
- dev and desktop still own runtime-producer logic
- pruning, patching, and sidecar layout already define product capability boundaries, but remain encoded as scattered scripts

That fragmentation has a practical cost: it blocks the highest-value runtime work.

The primary reason to split out `packages/slimclaw` is not aesthetic architecture cleanup. It is to create a single closed-loop runtime owner so Nexu can make larger, more aggressive OpenClaw runtime optimizations safely.

The first visible payoffs are expected to be:

- prebundle-driven reductions in install and build time
- cleaner cold-start strategy with lower startup latency
- cleaner health/readiness strategy with less startup uncertainty and recovery overhead

The architectural cleanup matters, but mainly because it enables those optimizations to happen in one place instead of being spread across historical runtime scaffolding.

## Goals

1. Make `packages/slimclaw` the single runtime owner.
2. Make `packages/slimclaw/build.mjs` the single runtime build entry.
3. Converge all runtime consumers on a slimclaw-owned path contract.
4. Ensure dev, controller, desktop, and tests consume runtime artifacts but do not produce them.
5. Remove `openclaw-runtime` and `openclaw-runtime-patches` completely.

## Expected Payoff

The long-term architectural benefit is real, but the main payoff is more concrete: once slimclaw becomes the single runtime owner, Nexu can optimize OpenClaw runtime behavior as a self-contained system.

That enables work that is much harder in the current layout, especially:

- prebundle optimization to cut install and build time
- better cold-start behavior to reduce startup latency
- better runtime health/readiness handling to reduce startup delays and monitoring complexity

In other words, `packages/slimclaw` is the natural long-term shape because it turns an already-existing runtime subsystem into a real optimization boundary.

## Non-Goals

- changing core OpenClaw behavior
- redesigning controller or desktop product semantics
- freezing every archive, cache, or patch implementation detail in this plan

## Fixed Principles

- **No magic**: slimclaw declares the `openclaw` dependency directly and builds from that.
- **Auto build by default**: repo install prepares the runtime automatically; explicit opt-out remains supported.
- **Path-only contract**: slimclaw exposes artifact paths, not an extra behavior wrapper.
- **Thin artifact**: artifact modeling stays minimal; prefer direct dist output plus archive packaging.
- **Packaging-only mutations**: prune, prebundle, and patch exist only to optimize packaging and preserve required Nexu fixes; they must not redefine OpenClaw core behavior.
- **Quick fail**: patch, prebundle, and build failures must fail immediately; no silent fallback to an unpatched artifact.

## Contracts We Can Freeze Now

### External interface boundary

All of the following are in scope for convergence onto slimclaw:

- root/build entrypoints
- dev entrypoints
- controller entrypoints
- desktop build/runtime entrypoints
- test entrypoints

Tests are part of the external interface migration, not a cleanup-afterward task.

Reason: tests already encode today's runtime contract. Leaving them behind would keep two contracts alive: one for production and one for tests.

Representative existing couplings include:

- `scripts/dev/src/shared/dev-runtime-config.ts`
- `apps/controller/src/runtime/openclaw-process.ts`
- `apps/desktop/scripts/prepare-openclaw-sidecar.mjs`

### Contracts to keep

The contracts worth preserving are path contracts, not legacy directory names:

- runtime root: a stable artifact root that consumers can resolve
- runtime entry: `node_modules/openclaw/openclaw.mjs`
- runtime bin: `bin/openclaw`, `bin/openclaw.cmd`, `bin/openclaw-gateway`
- manifest path: a minimal manifest path may be exposed if needed for lookup and invalidation
- packaged runtime validation may continue to key off the presence of `node_modules/openclaw/openclaw.mjs`

At minimum, slimclaw should provide a stable path contract for:

- runtime root
- entry path
- bin path
- optional manifest path

### Contracts to remove

- top-level `openclaw-runtime/`
- top-level `openclaw-runtime-patches/`
- root `openclaw-runtime:*` scripts
- direct consumer references to `openclaw-runtime/node_modules/...`
- dev/desktop-owned patch, stage, or runtime-producer logic

## Required Slimclaw Capabilities

The following capabilities are already justified by current repo behavior and can be frozen in this plan.

1. **Explicit dependency ownership**
   - slimclaw declares and builds `openclaw` directly.

2. **Default auto-build with explicit opt-out**
   - runtime preparation remains automatic on install.

3. **Fingerprint, cache, and reuse**
   - unchanged inputs should reuse prior outputs
   - changed inputs must invalidate and rebuild

4. **Pruning as an owned build responsibility**
   - prune policy is part of the build pipeline and part of artifact invalidation

5. **Transactional artifact build**
   - build into a candidate output, validate it, then switch over
   - do not patch fragile files in-place on the final consumer path

6. **Quick-fail patching**
   - missing anchors, missing files, or incompatible bundles must fail the build immediately

7. **Thin artifact output**
   - slimclaw outputs the runtime artifact plus only the minimal manifest/path data needed by consumers

8. **Archive/materialize support for packaged runtime**
   - packaged desktop flows must continue to support archived artifacts and extracted artifacts

9. **Spawn-by-path and stdout-event compatibility**
   - controller continues to launch runtime by resolved path
   - existing stdout-driven `NEXU_EVENT` consumption remains compatible

## Consumer Boundary After Refactor

### dev

dev should only:

- ensure slimclaw is built
- resolve the slimclaw runtime entry path
- launch the runtime

dev should no longer patch, stage, or produce runtime artifacts.

### controller

controller should only:

- resolve slimclaw entry/bin/root paths
- launch and supervise the runtime
- consume runtime events

controller should no longer guess repo-local fallback paths or scan legacy runtime roots.

### desktop

desktop should only:

- consume slimclaw artifacts
- package, archive, materialize, and launch those artifacts

desktop should no longer patch OpenClaw a second time or own its own runtime-producer logic.

Small transitional adapters are acceptable during rollout, but they must not become new runtime producers.

## Implementation Sequence

### 1. External interface decoupling

Keep the compatibility layer as thin as possible and move every runtime entrypoint to slimclaw.

Done when:

- all root, dev, controller, desktop, and test entrypoints resolve runtime through slimclaw-owned path contracts
- any compatibility layer is limited to path redirection, manifest lookup, entry resolution, or small transitional adaptation
- no compatibility layer patches, stages, or produces runtime artifacts

Exit condition: no maintained caller still needs to know the legacy runtime package name or layout.

### 2. Internal implementation alignment

Move all producer responsibilities into slimclaw.

Done when:

- patch source of truth is singular
- prune/build/fingerprint/layout ownership is singular
- dev and desktop no longer own runtime-producer logic

This may overlap locally with step 1 where necessary.

Exit condition: slimclaw is the only place where runtime artifacts are built, patched, pruned, or staged.

### 3. Full regression pass

Verify:

- build artifact correctness
- consumer-chain correctness for dev, controller, and desktop
- capability regressions for:
  - Feishu patched path
  - `NEXU_EVENT channel.reply_outcome`
  - PDF parsing
  - Playwright-backed browser interaction

Exit condition: the slimclaw-owned pipeline preserves the runtime-critical flows the legacy pipeline was responsible for.

### 4. Legacy removal

After the first three steps are stable, remove:

- `openclaw-runtime/`
- `openclaw-runtime-patches/`
- legacy root scripts
- legacy path references
- legacy test entrypoints

Exit condition: deleting the legacy runtime directories does not break build, dev, controller, desktop, or test flows.

## Details Intentionally Deferred

The following are real implementation topics but should not be frozen at the plan level yet:

- exact patch representation (`overlay` vs imperative vs declarative)
- exact archive/extraction format or algorithm (`zip`, `tar`, `7z`, sync vs async)
- exact cache filenames, stamp schemas, or internal directory layout
- exact node-runtime selection heuristics
- exact prune allow/deny lists
- exact shape of temporary desktop transitional adapters

## Done When

- `packages/slimclaw` is the only runtime owner
- `packages/slimclaw/build.mjs` is the only runtime build entry
- all runtime consumers resolve artifacts through slimclaw-owned path contracts
- dev and desktop no longer contain runtime-producer logic
- regression coverage passes for build, consumer flows, and key runtime capabilities
- `openclaw-runtime` and `openclaw-runtime-patches` are deleted
